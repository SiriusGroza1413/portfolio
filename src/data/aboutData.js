    description1: "Hi and welcome to my portfolio! I'm Guillermo, a web developer based in Argentina and I will tell you some things about me... I started in the IT world just over a year ago, during the last months I have been learning a lot and getting involved with some projects (individual and group) where during more than 700 hours of intense coding I managed to obtain new skills that allowed me to continue growing as a person and intellectually, I met incredible people along the way, overcoming challenges and discovering new facets of myself through the last months...",
    description2: "I consider myself someone who is very persuasive and communicative when it is really necessary, flexible and quickly get used to any change. I love learning a little of everything every day, listening to music, playing the guitar, exercising, they are things that free my mind and show me new solutions and paths when it comes to doing my job. When I had my first contact with web development I realized that I can demand a lot from myself, that I am capable of many things that I thought I could not do, dealing with frustration and always keeping calm knowing that in the end I was going to overcome it, and so on. it was... many times, every time. On the one hand it was the passion and the joy of seeing that I was creating something, on the other hand it was the knowledge that brought me every day, as they say: knowledge is power.",
