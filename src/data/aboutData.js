    description1: "Hi and welcome to my portfolio! I'm Guillermo, a web developer based in Argentina and I will tell you some things about me... I started in the IT world just over a year ago, during the last months I have been learning a lot and getting involved with some projects (individual and group) where I was able to put my technical and soft skills into practice",
    description2: "I consider myself someone who is very persuasive and communicative when it is really necessary. I like to have an eye for details as well as put myself in someone else's place. I am also very flexible and quickly get used to any change. I love learning a little of everything every day, listening to music, playing the guitar, exercising, they are things that free my mind and show me new solutions and paths when it comes to doing my job..",
